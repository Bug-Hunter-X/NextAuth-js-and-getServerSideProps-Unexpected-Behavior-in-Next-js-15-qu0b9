# NextAuth.js and getServerSideProps Unexpected Behavior in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using NextAuth.js for authentication within a Next.js 15 application.  The problem arises when attempting to access a protected route after successful login.  The session data sometimes appears unexpectedly null or incomplete, leading to inconsistent rendering.

## Problem Description

The `about.js` file uses `getServerSideProps` to fetch session data from NextAuth.js.  While login appears successful, the `session` object passed to the component is occasionally undefined or lacks expected properties, causing incorrect display of login status.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe inconsistent rendering; sometimes shows logged in status correctly, other times incorrectly.

## Possible Causes

* Issues with `unstable_getServerSession` in NextAuth.js interactions with Next.js 15
* Caching issues related to session data
* Asynchronous operations within `getServerSideProps` handling

## Potential Solution

The solution might involve modifications to how session data is fetched and handled within the `getServerSideProps` function or exploring alternative authentication strategies.

This issue is crucial for developers using NextAuth.js and `getServerSideProps` together in Next.js 15 applications.
